# Replications in Software Engineering

Below we have started to list replications of Software Engineering studies. The list is incomplete. If your replication or replicated paper is missing please do a pull request! Or contact Robert Feldt (google is your friend for his email / contact info :)). Papers are listed in reverse chronological order of original paper, per ROSE Festival in which they were presented (or Other, see below).
